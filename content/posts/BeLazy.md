## Need for Innovation

People tend to be lazy and seek shortcuts in real life. If a shortcut doesnâ€™t exist, the lazy but smart individuals will try to invent one. This is how innovation happens.

## Joy of Creation

However, it's strange that some hackers[^1]often prefer to code most things themselves. This seems counterintuitive at first. But upon closer examination, the difference becomes clear.

In the first scenario, the goal is to complete the task efficiently. In the second scenario, the goal is to enjoy the process of creation. While both approaches aim to achieve a result, they focus on different aspects.

## Always be Lazy

Is there a way to always link **creation** with **innovation**?

The answer is to **always be lazy** as possible as you can.

Being lazy means to seek the best existing shortcut. The key is to be **critical** of the shortcut and **try to be more lazy**. This approach helps you understand best practices and provides an opportunity to create an even more efficient path. This not only enhances your enjoyment but also results in solutions that others can appreciate and benefit from.

[^1]: Yep, my name is *some hackers* : ).
