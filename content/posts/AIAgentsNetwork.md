## Web

The rise of the Internet is based on the World Wide Web (WWW). Computers can perform various tasks, and the Web enables the connection of computers worldwide, allowing them to collaborate and achieve remarkable outcomes.

## AI Agent Network

Advancements in Large Language Models have made general AI intelligence possible. AI agents are now capable of performing a wide range of tasks. However, there are numerous frameworks and applications for AI agents that cannot communicate with one another due to differing standards and the absence of a unified domain system. This situation is similar to the early days of computers before the Internet: powerful individually, but with even greater potential when interconnected.

The proposal is an initial idea that doesn't encompass all the nuances. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial to demonstrate and explore the concept of a domain system for AI agents to collaborate.

If successful, the following infrastructure will be required to support the AI Agent Network:

- AI Agent ID and Authentication
- Standardized Communication Protocols
- Centralized Domain System for AI Agents
- Security and Privacy Measures
- ...

This infrastructure will enable AI agents to identify, authenticate, and communicate with each other, unlocking their full potential through collaboration.
